The length of 40 leaves of a plant are measured correct to one millimetre, and the obtained data is represented in the following table:\\
\begin{table}[ht!]
\centering
\input{./stat/tables/exer40/inp40.tex}
\caption{Lengths of 40 leaves in mm}
\label{table:input_stat40}
\end{table}
(i) Draw a histogram to represent the given data. [Hint: First make the class intervals continuous]\\
(ii) Is there any other suitable graphical representation for the same data?\\
(iii) Is it correct to conclude that the maximum number of leaves are 153 mm long?\\
why?\\
