A study was conducted to find out the concentration of sulphur dioxide in the air in parts per million (ppm) of a certain city. The data obtained for 30 days is as follows:
\begin{table}[ht!]
\centering
\input{./stat/tables/exer32/sulphur.tex}
\caption{Concentrations of sulphur dioxide in air in ppm for 30 days}
\label{table:sulphurdioxide_concentration}
\end{table}
(i)Make a grouped frequency distribution table for this data with class intervals as 0.00-0.04, 0.04-0.08, and so on.\\
(ii) For how many days, was the concentration of sulphur dioxide more than 0.11 parts per million?\\
