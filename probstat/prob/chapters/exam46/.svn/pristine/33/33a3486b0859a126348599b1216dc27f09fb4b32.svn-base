let X be the random variable representing the result when a die is thrown
\begin{align}
X \epsilon \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\}
\end{align}
All results are equally likely in a fair die. Hence 
\begin{align}
\pr{X = 6} = \frac{1}{6}
\\
\pr{X \neq 6} = \frac{5}{6}
\end{align}
For A to win the game at k-th throw, A should throw a 6 in the k-th throw and both A and B must not throw a six in the preceding \brac{k-1} throws.So probability of A winning after k thows is given as
\begin{align}
\pr{A_k}={\frac{5}{6}}^{k-1}\frac{1}{6}
k \epsilon \{1,2....\infty\}
\end{align}
So the total probability of A winning is given as
\begin{align}
\pr{A}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\pr{A_k}
\\
\pr{A}=\frac{1}{6}+{\frac{5}{6}}^{2}\times\frac{1}{6}+{\frac{5}{6}}^{4}\times\frac{1}{6}+....
\\
\pr{A}=\frac{1}{6}\times\brak{1+{\frac{5}{6}}^{2}+{\frac{5}{6}}^{4}+....}
\\
\pr{A}=\frac{1}{6}\times\frac{1}{1-{\frac{5}{6}}^2}
\\
\pr{A}=\frac{6}{11}
\end{align}
Similarly probability of B winning is given as
\begin{align}
\pr{B}=\frac{5}{6}\times\frac{1}{6}+{\frac{5}{6}}^{3}\times\frac{1}{6}+{\frac{5}{6}}^{5}\times\frac{1}{6}+....
\\
\pr{B}=\frac{1}{6}\times\frac{5}{6}\times\brak{1+{\frac{5}{6}}^{2}+{\frac{5}{6}}^{4}+....}
\\
\pr{B}=\frac{5}{11}
\end{align}
