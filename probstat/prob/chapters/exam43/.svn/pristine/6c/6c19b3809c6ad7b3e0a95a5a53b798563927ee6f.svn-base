Coloured balls are distributed in four boxes as shown in the following table:\\
\\$\begin{tabular}{||c c c c c||} 
 \hline
 Box & Black & White & Red & Blue \\
 \hline\hline
 I & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
 \hline
 II & 2 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\
 \hline
 III & 1 & 2 & 3 & 1 \\
 \hline
 IV & 4 & 3 & 1 & 5 \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}$\\
\\A box is selected at random and then a ball is randomly drawn from the selected box. The colour of the ball is black, what is the probability that ball drawn is from the box III?
