Coloured balls are distributed in four boxes as shown in the following table:\\
\begin{table}[ht!]

\input{./prob/tables/boxes43.tex}
\caption{Distribution of the balls in the boxes}
\label{table:boxes}
\end{table}
A box is selected at random and then a ball is randomly drawn from the selected box. The colour of the ball is black, what is the probability that ball drawn is from the box III?
