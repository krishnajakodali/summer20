The sample size= total faces of a die
\begin{align}
S=6
\end{align}
(i)number of faces on which letter A appears
\begin{align}
A=2
\end{align}
The probability of getting an A
\begin{align}
\pr{A} = \frac{A}{S} &= \frac{2}{6}
\\
&= \frac{1}{3}
\end{align}

(ii)number of faces on which letter D appears
\begin{align}
D=1
\end{align}
The probability of getting an A
\begin{align}
\pr{D} = \frac{D}{S} &= \frac{1}{6}
\end{align}
