Let X be the random variable representing the number of defective eggs from the ten eggs picked.X follows binomial distribution.
Probability that there is atleast one defective egg is 
\begin{align}
\pr{X \geq 1}= 1 - \pr{X=0} 
\end{align}
Substituting n=10,p= 0.1 and k=0 in equation \eqref{eq:exam41_1}, 
\begin{align}
\pr{X \geq 1}= 1 - \comb{10}{0}0.1^k\brak{0.9}^\brak{10}
\\
&=1-{\frac{9}{10}}^{10}
\\
&=0.6513215599
\end{align}
