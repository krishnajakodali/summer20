Five cardsâ€”the ten, jack, queen, king and ace of diamonds, are well-shuffled with their
face downwards. One card is then picked up at random.\\
(i) What is the probability that the card is the queen?\\
(ii) If the queen is drawn and put aside, what is the probability that the second card
picked up is (a) an ace? (b) a queen?
