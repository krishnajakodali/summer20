Let X be the random variable representing the number that arrow points
\begin{align}
X \epsilon \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}
\end{align}
Since all events are equally likely,
\begin{align}
\pr{X=x}=\begin{cases}
	\frac{1}{8}& x=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\\
	0 & otherwise
	\end{cases}
\end{align}
\brak{i}The probability that the outcome is 8 is 
\begin{align}
\pr{X=8} = \frac{1}{8}
\end{align}

\brak{ii}Probability of occurance of odd numbers is
\begin{align}
\pr{X=1}+\pr{X=3}+\pr{X=5}+\pr{X=7}
 \\
\implies 4 \times \frac{1}{8}=\frac{4}{8}=\frac{1}{2}
\end{align}
\brak{iii}Probability of arrow pointing at a number greater than 2 is
\begin{align}
\pr{X > 2}=1 -\pr{X < 2} 
\\
\implies 1-\brak{\pr{X=1}+\pr{X=2}}
\\
\implies 1-\frac{2}{8}=\frac{3}{4}
\end{align}
 \brak{iv} Probability of arrow pointing at a value less than 9 is
\begin{align}
\pr{X < 9} =\frac{8}{8}=1
\end{align}

The python code for the distribution is
\begin{lstlisting}
./prob/codes/chance.py
\end{lstlisting}
The above code checks occurance of each of these events when the arrow is spinned 100,000 times.
