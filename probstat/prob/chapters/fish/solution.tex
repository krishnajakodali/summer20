The sample size is the total number of fishes in the tank 
\begin{align}
S=5+8=13
\end{align}
The number male fishes 
\begin{align}
M=5
\end{align}
The probability of gopi picking up a male fish is
\begin{align}
\pr{M} = \frac{M}{S} &= \frac{5}{13}
\end{align}
The python code for the distribution is
\begin{lstlisting}
./prob/codes/fish.py
\end{lstlisting}
The code checks how many times a male fish is picked out of the total times (taken as 100,000 in the given code) a fish is picked up from the tank with replacement.
