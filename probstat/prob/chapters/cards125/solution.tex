The sample size = total number of cards ina deck
\begin{align}
S=52
\end{align}
\brak{i} Number of kings of red color in a deck
\begin{align}
E_1=2
\end{align}
The probability of drawing a king of red colour 
\begin{align}
\pr{E_1} = \frac{E_1}{S} &= \frac{2}{52}
\\
&= \frac{1}{23}
\end{align}


\brak{ii} Number of face cards in a deck
\begin{align}
E_2=12
\end{align}
The probability of drawing a face card is 
\begin{align}
\pr{E_2} = \frac{E_2}{S} &= \frac{12}{52}
\\
&= \frac{3}{13}
\end{align}


\brak{iii} Number of face cards of red color in a deck
\begin{align}
E_3=6
\end{align}
The probability of drawing a red face card from the deck is 
\begin{align}
\pr{E_3} = \frac{E_3}{S} &= \frac{6}{52}
\\
&= \frac{3}{23}
\end{align}


\brak{iv} Number of jacks of hearts in a deck
\begin{align}
E_4=1
\end{align}
The probability of drawing a jack of hearts is 
\begin{align}
\pr{E_4} = \frac{E_4}{S} &= \frac{1}{52}
\end{align}


\brak{v} Number of spades in a deck
\begin{align}
E_5=13
\end{align}
The probability of drawing a spade is 
\begin{align}
\pr{E_5} = \frac{E_5}{S} &= \frac{13}{52}
\\
&= \frac{1}{4}
\end{align}


\brak{v} Number of queens of diamond in a deck
\begin{align}
E_6=1
\end{align}
The probability of drawing a queen of diamond is 
\begin{align}
\pr{E_6} = \frac{E_6}{S} &= \frac{1}{52}
\end{align}
