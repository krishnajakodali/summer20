The sample size 
\begin{align}
S=3
\end{align}
(i)The number of yellow balls are
\begin{align}
Y=1
\end{align}
The probability that a yellow ball is taken out is 
\begin{align}
\pr{Y} = \frac{Y}{S} &= \frac{1}{3}
\end{align}
(ii)The number of red balls are
\begin{align}
R=1
\end{align}
The probability that a yellow ball is taken out is 
\begin{align}
\pr{R} = \frac{R}{S} &= \frac{1}{3}
\end{align}
(iii)The number of blue balls are
\begin{align}
B=1
\end{align}
The probability that a yellow ball is taken out is 
\begin{align}
\pr{B} = \frac{B}{S} &= \frac{1}{3}
\end{align}
