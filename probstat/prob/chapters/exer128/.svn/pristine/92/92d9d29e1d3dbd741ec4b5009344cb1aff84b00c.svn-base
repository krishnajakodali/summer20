(i)The sample size 
\begin{align}
S=20
\end{align}
The number of defective bulbs is 
\begin{align}
D=4
\end{align}
The probability of drawing a defective bulb is 
\begin{align}
\pr{D} = \frac{D}{S} &= \frac{4}{20}
\\
&= \frac{1}{5}
\end{align}
(ii)After drawing a non defective bulb 
The new sample size 
\begin{align}
S'=19
\end{align}
The number of non-defective bulbs in remaining lot is 
\begin{align}
N=20-4-1=15
\end{align}
The probability of drawing a non-defective bulb is 
\begin{align}
\pr{N} = \frac{N}{S'} &= \frac{15}{19}
\end{align}
